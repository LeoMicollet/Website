## My PhD
* **Subject:** Stochastic and deterministic modeling of insect population control by releasing sterile males - Applications in agro-ecology and epidemiology.

* Started on October 2024.

* **Supervisors:** [Camille Coron](https://camillecoron.github.io/) and [Luis Almeida](https://www.ljll.fr/~almeida/).

## Research Interests
I study stochastic tools such as branching processes, birth-death processes, and stochastic diffusion to model the behavior of insect populations, specifically *Aedes polynesiensis*, based on data from the Tetiaroa atoll. 

My research focuses on studying the conditions for extinction or control of extinction of a given population using Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) or Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT).
